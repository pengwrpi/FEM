a1triangle_bigger.cc: the file to create the mesh with triangle elements
a1quad.cc: the code to create mesh with quadilateral elements

At this moment, both of them could only create rectangular model

both take 7 command line arguments:

<number of vertices in x direction>
<number of vertices in y direction>
<length of x direction>
<length of y direction>
<linear or quadratic element>
<filename of mesh created>

Compilation:
    ./setup_right.sh
    ./build.sh a1quad/a1triangle_bigger
