This is the Finite Element Analysis Code used for 2D linear elastic problem.
The FEA.h is the header file for the class FEA, FEA.cpp is the constructor.
FEA_main.cpp is the file where main function is.
All other *.cpp files are the member functions of FEA, except that shapefunction.cpp
stores all the shapefunction, shapefunction derivatives and integration rules.
Please look at CMakeLists.txt about how the program is compiled.

Three command line arguments are needed, i.e., mesh file, Element_info.txt, Load_info.txt.
Below are the format of the files.

The first command line argument should be mesh file name.

The format of the Element_info.txt file, which should be the second command line argument.
<type> (linear or quadratic)
<G nu planestrain/stress>
<number of nodes with restricted dof>
<node#> <dim> <type> <condition>
<node#> <dim> <type> <condition>
.
.
.
.
<node#> <dim> <type> <condition>


The format of the load_info.txt file, which should be the third command line argument.
<body_f[0] body_f[1]>
<number of elements loaded by traction>
<lsit of indices of elements loaded by traction>
<number of edges loaded> <list of these edges> <traction[0]> <traction[1]> ...<traction[0]> <traction[1]> 
<number of edges loaded> <list of these edges> <traction[0]> <traction[1]> ...<traction[0]> <traction[1]> 
.
.
.
.
<number of edges loaded> <list of these edges> <traction[0]> <traction[1]> ...<traction[0]> <traction[1]> 

The results are written in the file FEA_result.txt
Displacement of nodes, stress and strain at each integration points are listed.
